# Notes on 'SQL: The Complete Reference' (2)

## Functions

The implementation of `SQL functions` varies significantly across different `DBMS`, making them unportable.

Common SQL function categories:

| Type | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | 
| Text Functions | Handle text strings (remove, pad, change case, etc.) |
| Numeric Functions | Perform arithmetic operations on numeric data (absolute value, algebraic operations) |
| Date and Time Functions | Handle date and time values (calculate date differences, check date validity, etc.) |
| System Functions | Return special information used by the DBMS (e.g., user login information) |

### Text Processing Functions

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| LEFT() | Returns the leftmost characters of a string |
| LENGTH() | Returns the length of a string |
| LOWER() | Converts to lowercase |
| LTRIM() | Removes leading spaces |
| RIGHT() | Returns the rightmost characters of a string |
| RTRIM() | Removes trailing spaces |
| SOUNDEX() | Returns the SOUNDEX value of a string |
| UPPER() | Converts to uppercase |

`SOUNDEX` is a function that converts a string to a code representing its sound. For example, `Peterson` will be converted to `P362`.

```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE SOUNDEX(cust_contact) = SOUNDEX('Michael Green')
```

### Date and Time Processing Functions

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| AddDate() | Adds a date (day, week, etc.) |
| AddTime() | Adds time (hours, minutes, etc.) |
| Now() | Returns the current date and time |
| CurDate() | Returns the current date |
| CurTime() | Returns the current time |
| Date() | Returns the date part of a datetime |
| DateDiff() | Calculates the difference between two dates |
| Date_Add() | Highly flexible date operation function |
| Date_Format() | Returns a formatted date or time string |
| DayOfWeek() | For a date, returns the corresponding day of the week |
| Time() | Returns the time part of a datetime |
| Year() | Returns the year part of a date |
| Month() | Returns the month part of a date |
| Day() | Returns the day part of a date |
| Hour() | Returns the hour part of a time |
| Minute() | Returns the minute part of a time |
| Second() | Returns the second part of a time |

### Numeric Processing Functions

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| ABS() | Absolute value |
| COS() | Cosine |
| EXP() | Exponential value |
| PI() | Value of Pi |
| SIN() | Sine |
| SQRT() | Square root |
| TAN() | Tangent |

## Summarizing Data

* Aggregate function

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| AVG() | Average value |
| COUNT() | Number of rows in a column |
| MAX() | Maximum value |
| MIN() | Minimum value |
| SUM() | Sum |

```SQL
SELECT AVG(prod_price) AS avg_price
FROM Products;
```

* `COUNT(*)` includes null values.

## Grouping Data

### Creating Groups

`GROUP BY` clause must be placed after `WHERE` and before `ORDER BY`.

```SQL
SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods
FROM Products
GROUP BY vend_id;
```

### Filtering Groups

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups.

```SQL
SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods
FROM Products
GROUP BY vend_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

## Subqueries

* Query (`query`)
* Subquery (`subquery`)

```SQL
SELECT cust_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_num IN (SELECT order_num 
                    FROM OrderItems
                    WHERE prod_id = 'D1')
```

* Subqueries are always processed *from the inside out*.

## Joining Tables

* Join (`join`)
* Scale (`scale`)
* Cartesian Product (`cartesian product`)
* Cross Join (`cross join`)
* Equijoin (`equijoin`)
* Inner Join (`inner join`)
* Self-Join (`self-join`)
* Natural Join (`natural join`)
* Outer Join (`outer join`)

### Creating Joins

```SQL
SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors, Products
WHERE Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
```

### Inner Join

`INNER JOIN xxx ON xxxx`

```SQL
SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors INNER JOIN Products
ON Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
```

### Table Aliases

```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers AS C, Orders AS O, OrderItems AS OI
WHERE C.cust_id = O.cust_id
    AND OI.order_num = O.order_num
    AND prod_id = 'D1'
```

* *Self-joins* are faster than *subqueries*, so joins should be used whenever possible.

## Combining Queries

`UNION` keyword

```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_state IN ('IL', 'IN', 'MI')
UNION
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_name = 'a'
```
Equivalent to:

```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_state IN ('IL', 'IN', 'MI')
    OR cust_name = 'a'
```

* Each query must contain the same columns.
* Data types do not need to be identical, but they must be compatible (convertible).
* `UNION` removes duplicates by default; use `UNION ALL` if you want to keep them.
* Only one `ORDER BY` clause is allowed, and it must be placed at the end.
