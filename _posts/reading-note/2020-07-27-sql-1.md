# Notes on 'SQL: The Complete Reference' (1)

SQL, or `Structured Query Language`, has syntax and features that vary depending on the specific `DBMS` (Database Management System) implementation. The following examples include only general SQL and MySQL examples.

## Database

* Database Management System (`DBMS`)
* Database (`database`)
* Table (`table`)
    - Schema (`schema`): Describes the information of the table.
    - Table names must be unique within the same database.
* Column (`column`)
    - Data type (`datatype`)
* Row (`row`)
    - Also known as a `record`
* Primary Key (`primary key`)
    - Uniquely identifies each row in the table, cannot be changed, and cannot be reused after deletion.
    - Can be a combination of multiple columns as a composite key.

## Retrieval

### SELECT

* If no sort order is specified, the output order may vary.
* Ends with a semicolon `;`, logically split into multiple lines.
* SQL keywords are written in uppercase for readability.
* Clause (`clause`)

```sql
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;
```

### Retrieving Multiple Columns

Separate columns with commas `,`, no comma after the last column.

```sql
SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products;
```

### Retrieving All Columns

The `*` wildcard is used to retrieve all columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products;
```

### Retrieving Unique Values

The `DISTINCT` keyword only returns unique values and applies to all specified columns.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT vend_id
FROM Products;
```

### Limiting Results

* The first row is indexed as 0.

Use the `LIMIT` keyword to return a maximum of `n` rows.

```sql
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
LIMIT 5;
```

Use the `OFFSET` keyword to start counting from the nth row.

```sql
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 4;
```

A shorthand version, where the first value is `OFFSET` and the second is `LIMIT`.

```sql
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
LIMIT 4, 3;
```

### Comments

Use `--`, `#`, or `/* */` for comments.

```sql
SELECT prod_name -- This is a comment
FROM Products;
```

```sql
# This is a comment
SELECT prod_name 
FROM Products;
```

```sql
/* This is
a multi-line comment */
SELECT prod_name 
FROM Products;
```

## Sorting Data

### Ordering Data

The `ORDER BY` keyword can only be placed at the end of the query.

```sql
SELECT prod_name 
FROM Products
ORDER BY prod_name;
```

Sorting by multiple fields.

```sql
SELECT prod_name 
FROM Products
ORDER BY prod_price, prod_name;
```

Sorting by column position; the following example sorts by `prod_price, prod_name`.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price, prod_name
FROM Products
ORDER BY 2, 3;
```

### Sorting Direction

`ASC` is the default ascending order (A to Z), and `DESC` is descending order (Z to A). Sorting is case-insensitive by default; "A" and "a" are treated the same unless settings are changed.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price, prod_name
FROM Products
ORDER BY prod_price DESC;
```

## Filtering Data

### WHERE Clause

* Search criteria
* Filter criteria

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price = 3.49;
```

### WHERE Clause Operators

| Operator | Description | Operator | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| = | Equal to | > | Greater than |
| <> | Not equal to | >= | Greater than or equal to |
| != | Not equal to | !> | Not greater than |
| < | Less than | BETWEEN | Between two values |
| <= | Less than or equal to | IS NULL | Is NULL |
| !< | Not less than |  |  |

### Checking Single Values

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price < 10;
```

When comparing strings, use quotation marks.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name != 'abc';
```

`BETWEEN` matches a range, including both endpoints.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price BETWEEN 0 AND 10;
```

Null value check, matches only `NULL`, not `0`.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price IS NULL;
```

### Combining WHERE Clauses

#### Operator

`AND` operator.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id = 'D1' AND prod_price <= 4;
```

`OR` operator.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id = 'D1' OR vend_id = 'D2';
```

`IN` operator.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id IN ( 'D1', 'D2' );
```

`NOT` operator.

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE NOT vend_id = 'D1';
```

#### Order of Evaluation

`AND` has a higher precedence than `OR`. Multiple operators should be separated by parentheses `()`.

## Filtering with Wildcards

* Wildcard (`wildcard`)
* Search pattern (`search pattern`)
* Predicate (`predicate`)

The percent symbol `%` is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters but does not match `NULL`.

| Wildcard | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| % | Matches zero or more characters, does not match `NULL` | 
| _ | Matches a single character | 
| [] | Specifies a set of characters; use `^` to negate | 

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE '%Fish%';
```

```sql
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE '[^JM]%';
```

* Searches are case-insensitive.
* Avoid overusing wildcards; use other operators first.
* If necessary, place the wildcard at the end of the search pattern.

## Calculated Fields

* Field (`field`)
* Concatenate (`concatenate`)

### Concatenating Fields

`||` operator.

```sql
SELECT vend_name + ' (' + vend_country + ')'
FROM Vendors
ORDER BY vend_name;
```

MySQL uses the `Concat` function.

```sql
SELECT Concat(vend_name, ' (', vend_country, ')')
FROM Vendors
ORDER BY vend_name;
```

### Aliases

* Alias (`alias`)
* Derived column (`derived column`)
 
The `AS` operator can be used to rename fields, especially when the field name is illegal or confusing.

```sql
SELECT vend_name AS vend_title
FROM Vendors
ORDER BY vend_name;
```

### Arithmetic Calculations

Add, subtract, multiply, divide `+-*/`.

```sql
SELECT prod_id, quantity, item_price, quantity*item_price AS expanded_price
FROM OrderItems
WHERE order_num = 20008;
```
